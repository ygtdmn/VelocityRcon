# VelocityRcon
Add RCON support to Velocity.

# What is this?
This allows using RCON Protocol in Velocity servers. You can send commands and read their results remotely.

You should use RCON for these situations:
- Communication between Paper/Sponge and Velocity servers.
- Or even Velocity to Velocity communication.
- You can use commands (to reward donators, punish players, etc.) from PHP and many other language.
